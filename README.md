## KWIX
KWIX is a payroll management system that I built to solve business problems for my client _Works of Art Construction LLC_. The client has multiple employees spread across multiple jobsites. They wanted an easy way to store:

*   Employee Information
*   Payroll Information
*   Jobsite Information
*   Paystub Information

KWIX assisted my client in managing labor costs, jobsite costs, time worked per employee and across jobsites and more.

### What is KWIX LITE?

KWIX LITE is a sandbox version of KWIX and it is the repository you are currently looking at.

KWIX LITE was designed to allow guest users to play around with KWIX in a sandbox environment. 
It is essentially a public demo that I can show off to new potential clients or recruiters who may be curious to see what I have built using springboot. 
Feel free to play around, but note that some features are disabled and all data is scoped to each user's session. 
Once a user logs out or their session expires all of their data is destroyed.
